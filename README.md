# DST

`Determine if a date is in daylight savings time by country/state/city`

## Motivation

I wasn't able to find a correct library to do the simple task `is my date during DST (Daylight Savings Time`. Every library was old or unconstistant because I learnt the hard way but not every Country/State/City have the same DST...

## Installation

```bash
npm install @remithomas/dst
```

## Implemented DST data

| Country | State     | City     | Years     |
| ------- | --------- | -------- | --------- |
| Canada  | Quebec    | Montreal | 2000-2030 |
|         | Ontario   | Toronto  |           |
| France  | Metropole | Paris    | 2000-2030 |
