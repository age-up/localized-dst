# localized DST

`Determine if a date is in daylight savings time by country/state/city`

## Motivation

I wasn't able to find a correct library to do the simple task `is my date during DST (Daylight Savings Time`. Every library was old or unconstistant because I learnt the hard way but not every Country/State/City have the same DST...

This is based on the information of https://www.timeanddate.com/time/dst/

## Installation

```bash
npm install localized-dst
```

## How to use it

```ts
import { isDst } from 'localized-dst';

// DST info for Canada, Québec, Montréal
console.log(
  isDst(new Date('2019-08-14 21:00:00'), {
    location: 'CAN.QUEBEC.MONTREAL'
  })
);
// return true

// DST info for France (Paris)
console.log(
  isDst(new Date('2019-11-28 21:00:00'), {
    location: 'FRA'
  })
);
// return false
```
